Binary type files in the directory are power traces when AES-128 running as the software implementation.
Make and use Hamming Waight table by Cipher texts' file "cipher_texts.npy", numpy data file.
Every trace file has traces by same plain texts and key sets.
The key is in the file "correct key.txt"

Trace points: 64623 points
Trace number per a file (an IC): 1000 traces
Points include information of 10th round: from 59500 to 61500 th

Naming rule of trace files:
"aging_wave_data_[index]day_240501.bin"
index: [IC index][key index]-[aging period]
IC index: 34, 38-50
kei index: "a" only (I changed key before, but now 1 key-set only.)
aging period: 0days or 4.5days(108 hours)*
     *It probably corresponds to about 2.4 years normal use.
